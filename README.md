I decided to rewrite the [Neural Networks Demystified](http://lumiverse.io/video/part-1-data-and-architecture) 
[examples](https://github.com/stephencwelch/Neural-Networks-Demystified) in [Racket](http://racket-lang.org) to improve the process of learning the matter at hand and 
to sharpen my Racket skills.
